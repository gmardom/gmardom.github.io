        <h1>üëã Hi, I'm Dominik!</h1>
        <p>
            I'm a self-taught programmer from Poland with a strong focus on simplicity and maintainability in my code. I particularly enjoy using the C programming language, as it allows me to write efficient and powerful applications. In addition to coding, I love to tinker with Linux, exploring its capabilities and customizing my environment to enhance my productivity.
